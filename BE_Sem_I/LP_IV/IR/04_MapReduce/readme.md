### **Assignment 4: Implementing MapReduce Processing Technique**

#### **Problem Statement**
Implement the MapReduce processing technique to perform a distributed computation task over a large dataset. The task involves processing and aggregating data in parallel using Map and Reduce functions.

#### **Objective**
- Understand the MapReduce paradigm for parallel processing.
- Learn how to split tasks into smaller subtasks (Map) and then combine results (Reduce) for efficient data processing.

#### **Outcome**
- Efficiently process large datasets using MapReduce.
- Gain hands-on experience with parallel and distributed data processing techniques.

#### **Software and Hardware Used**
- **OS**: 64-bit Ubuntu  
- **RAM**: 8GB (Recommended)  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Language**: Python

#### **Theory**
**MapReduce**:  
MapReduce is a programming model used for processing and generating large datasets. It works by splitting the task into two main steps:
1. **Map**: The Map function processes input data in parallel, producing intermediate key-value pairs.
2. **Reduce**: The Reduce function aggregates the intermediate results, producing the final output.

**Steps**:
1. The data is divided into smaller chunks, which are processed in parallel by the Map function.
2. The output of the Map function (key-value pairs) is sorted, and then the Reduce function is applied to aggregate the results.

#### **Algorithm**
1. **Map Function**:
   - Input: A dataset (list of records).
   - Process: Split the data into key-value pairs.
   - Output: A list of key-value pairs.

2. **Shuffle and Sort**:
   - Sort the output of the Map function by the key.

3. **Reduce Function**:
   - Input: Key and the list of values associated with that key.
   - Process: Aggregate the values for each key.
   - Output: The final reduced output.

4. **Final Output**: The processed data after the MapReduce operations.

#### **Test Cases**
1. **Input**:  
   `["apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana", "cherry"]`

   **Map Function Output**:  
   `[(apple, 1), (banana, 1), (apple, 1), (apple, 1), (banana, 1), (cherry, 1)]`

   **Reduce Function Output**:  
   `{"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "cherry": 1}`

2. **Input**:  
   `["dog", "cat", "dog", "bird", "cat", "dog"]`

   **Map Function Output**:  
   `[(dog, 1), (cat, 1), (dog, 1), (bird, 1), (cat, 1), (dog, 1)]`

   **Reduce Function Output**:  
   `{"dog": 3, "cat": 2, "bird": 1}`

#### **Python Code Implementation**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Map function
def map_function(data):
    map_output = []
    for item in data:
        map_output.append((item, 1))  # Emit key-value pair
    return map_output

# Reduce function
def reduce_function(mapped_data):
    reduce_output = defaultdict(int)
    for key, value in mapped_data:
        reduce_output[key] += value  # Aggregate values by key
    return dict(reduce_output)

# Example data
data = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Step 1: Map step
mapped_data = map_function(data)

# Step 2: Reduce step
reduced_data = reduce_function(mapped_data)

# Final result
print(reduced_data)
```

#### **Conclusion/Analysis**
The MapReduce technique was successfully implemented. The Map function divided the task into smaller chunks, while the Reduce function aggregated the results efficiently. This parallel processing approach can be scaled to large datasets and can be applied in distributed computing environments such as Hadoop and Spark for big data processing.
