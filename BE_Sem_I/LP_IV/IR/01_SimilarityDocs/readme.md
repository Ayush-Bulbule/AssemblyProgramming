### **Similarity of Documents - Extended Theory**

**Document Similarity** refers to the process of determining how similar two documents are, based on their content. It is widely used in Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and in search engines to measure how closely a document matches a query or another document.

There are various methods to measure the similarity between documents, with the **Cosine Similarity** method being one of the most popular. Other methods include **Jaccard Similarity** and **Euclidean Distance**.

- **Cosine Similarity** is based on the vector space model, where documents are represented as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine of the angle between two vectors (representing two documents) indicates how similar they are.

### **Concepts Related to Document Similarity**

1. **Vector Representation of Documents**:
   - A document is represented as a vector of terms (usually weighted by term frequency or TF-IDF).
   - Each dimension in the vector corresponds to a unique word in the document corpus.

2. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{cosine similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( A \) and \( B \) are two document vectors.
     - \( A \cdot B \) is the dot product of vectors A and B.
     - \( \|A\| \) and \( \|B\| \) are the magnitudes (norms) of vectors A and B.

3. **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
   - This is a weighting factor used to evaluate how important a word is to a document relative to the entire corpus.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{TF-IDF}(t,d) = \text{TF}(t,d) \times \log\left(\frac{N}{\text{DF}(t)}\right)
     \]
     Where:
     - \( \text{TF}(t,d) \) is the term frequency of term \( t \) in document \( d \).
     - \( N \) is the total number of documents.
     - \( \text{DF}(t) \) is the number of documents containing term \( t \).

4. **Jaccard Similarity**:
   - Measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of their intersection by the size of their union.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{Jaccard Similarity} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
     \]
     Where \( A \) and \( B \) are the sets of words in two documents.

### **Steps in Calculating Document Similarity**:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Convert the text into a uniform format (e.g., lowercase).
   - Remove stop words (e.g., "the", "and", "is").
   - Tokenize the text into words or phrases.

2. **Vectorization**:
   - Represent documents as vectors using methods like **Bag of Words (BoW)** or **TF-IDF**.

3. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Compute the similarity between two document vectors using cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, or other distance metrics.

4. **Ranking**:
   - Rank the documents based on their similarity to the query or to other documents.

### **Algorithm: Cosine Similarity Calculation**

1. **Input**: Two documents represented as vectors.
2. **Step 1**: Preprocess the documents (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.).
3. **Step 2**: Convert documents into a vector space model using TF or TF-IDF.
4. **Step 3**: Compute the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.
5. **Step 4**: Output the similarity score (0 for no similarity, 1 for exact similarity).

### **Test Input and Output Example**

Consider two documents:

**Document 1**: "Information retrieval is the process of finding relevant documents."
**Document 2**: "Retrieval of information from a collection of documents is essential."

#### **Step 1: Tokenization**:
- Document 1: ["information", "retrieval", "process", "finding", "relevant", "documents"]
- Document 2: ["retrieval", "information", "collection", "documents", "essential"]

#### **Step 2: Vectorization (TF-IDF)**:
- Document 1: { "information": 0.4, "retrieval": 0.3, "process": 0.2, "finding": 0.2, "relevant": 0.2, "documents": 0.2 }
- Document 2: { "retrieval": 0.3, "information": 0.3, "collection": 0.2, "documents": 0.2, "essential": 0.2 }

#### **Step 3: Cosine Similarity**:
   Calculate cosine similarity using the formula. After computation, you get a similarity score of **0.89**, indicating a high similarity.
