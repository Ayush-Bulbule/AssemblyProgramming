### **PageRank Algorithm - Extended Theory**

**PageRank** is an algorithm used by search engines like Google to rank web pages based on their importance. It was co-created by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The algorithm uses the structure of links in the web to assign each page a **PageRank** value. The more important a page is, the higher its PageRank, and the more likely it is to appear at the top of search results.

- **Basic Idea**: Pages that are linked to by other important pages receive a higher rank. The importance of a page is not solely based on the number of links it has, but also the importance of the pages that link to it.
  
- **The Mathematical Model**: 
   - PageRank of a page `A` is determined by the following formula:
   \[
   PR(A) = \frac{1 - d}{N} + d \left( \sum_{B \in M(A)} \frac{PR(B)}{L(B)} \right)
   \]
   Where:
   - `PR(A)` = PageRank of page A
   - `d` = Damping factor (usually set to 0.85)
   - `N` = Total number of pages
   - `M(A)` = Set of pages that link to page A
   - `L(B)` = Number of links on page B
   
   The damping factor `d` models the probability that a person will continue clicking on links versus jumping to a random page.

### **Further Insights on PageRank**

1. **Iterative Process**: PageRank works iteratively. In each iteration, the rank is updated based on the ranks of pages linking to it. The process continues until the ranks converge to stable values.

2. **Damping Factor**: The damping factor accounts for the randomness in web navigation. Without it, pages with no links would have a rank of zero. It ensures that even pages with no incoming links can still have a PageRank.

3. **Link Structure**: The link structure between web pages is crucial. A link from an important page carries more weight than one from an unimportant page.

4. **Practical Application**: PageRank was the foundation for Google's search ranking algorithm, helping it become more effective in providing relevant search results based on the importance of web pages.

### **Algorithm Steps in Detail**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by assigning an equal PageRank to all pages in the system. This can be done by dividing 1 by the total number of pages.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each page `u`, calculate the new PageRank by summing the PageRanks of pages that link to it, each divided by the number of links on those pages.
   
3. **Convergence**:
   - Repeat the process until the change in PageRank values between iterations is below a certain threshold, indicating convergence.

4. **Output**:
   - The final PageRank values will represent the importance of each page.

### **Test Input and Output Example**

Consider the following network of 4 web pages:
- Pages: A, B, C, D
- Links: B → A, C → A, D → A, B → C, D → C, D → B

**Initial PageRank**: Each page starts with an initial value of `1/4 = 0.25`.

#### **Iteration 1** (after the first calculation):
- Page A receives rank from B, C, and D, each divided by their outbound links.
- Page B gets rank from D.
- Page C gets rank from B and D.
- Page D gets rank from B and C.

After several iterations, Page A may have the highest PageRank, followed by Pages B, C, and D, depending on the number of inbound and outbound links.
