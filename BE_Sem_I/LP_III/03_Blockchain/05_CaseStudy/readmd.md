### Survey Report on Types of Blockchains and Real-Time Use Cases

---

#### **1. Introduction**
Blockchain technology has evolved significantly since its inception, giving rise to various types of blockchains tailored for specific use cases. This report categorizes blockchains into three main types: public, private, and consortium blockchains, along with real-world applications for each type.

#### **2. Types of Blockchains**

##### **2.1 Public Blockchains**
- **Definition**: Open and permissionless networks where anyone can participate as a user or miner. All transactions are publicly visible.
- **Examples**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin.
  
**Use Cases**:
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Platforms like Ethereum support smart contracts and dApps in finance, gaming, and more.
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Companies like IBM are exploring public blockchains for tracking products through supply chains.

---

##### **2.2 Private Blockchains**
- **Definition**: Restricted networks where access is limited to a specific group of participants. Centralized control allows for greater privacy.
- **Examples**: Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda.

**Use Cases**:
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Organizations like JPMorgan use private blockchains for secure internal transactions.
- **Data Sharing**: Healthcare providers share patient data securely and privately.
- **Asset Management**: Real estate firms manage property ownership and transactions with private ledgers.

---

##### **2.3 Consortium Blockchains**
- **Definition**: A hybrid model where multiple organizations share control over the blockchain. Access is limited to specific nodes, allowing for collaborative governance.
- **Examples**: R3 Corda, Quorum.

**Use Cases**:
- **Financial Services**: Banks collaborate on platforms like R3 Corda to streamline interbank transactions.
- **Energy Sector**: Utilities can use consortium blockchains for energy trading and management.
- **Cross-Organization Collaborations**: Companies in supply chain management (like IBM Food Trust) use consortium blockchains for transparency and accountability.

#### **3. Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Types**

| **Type of Blockchain** | **Accessibility**       | **Control**               | **Transaction Speed**      | **Privacy Level**     |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Public                 | Open to everyone       | Decentralized             | Moderate (e.g., Ethereum)  | Low                   |
| Private                | Permissioned           | Centralized               | High                        | High                  |
| Consortium             | Limited to members     | Semi-decentralized        | High                        | Medium to High        |

#### **4. Conclusion**
Blockchain technology's versatility is evident in its various forms, each suited to different needs and industries. Public blockchains emphasize decentralization and transparency, while private and consortium blockchains cater to specific organizational requirements, enhancing privacy and control. As blockchain continues to evolve, its applications are set to transform numerous sectors, driving efficiency and trust in data handling.
