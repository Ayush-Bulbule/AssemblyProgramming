### Assignment 1: Installation of MetaMask and study spending Ether per transaction.

#### Step 1: Install MetaMask
1. **Browser Extension**:
   - Go to the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
   - Click on the **"Download"** button and select your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
   - Follow the prompts to install the extension.

2. **Create a Wallet**:
   - Open the MetaMask extension.
   - Click on **"Get Started"**.
   - Choose **"Create a Wallet"** or **"Import Wallet"** if you already have one.
   - Follow the instructions to set up a password and backup your seed phrase.

#### Step 2: Connect to a Network
- After creating your wallet, connect to the Ethereum mainnet or a test network like Ropsten or Rinkeby.
- Click on the network dropdown at the top of the MetaMask window to select the desired network.

#### Step 3: Obtain Ether
- For test networks, obtain test Ether from a faucet. Search for "Ropsten faucet" or "Rinkeby faucet" online and follow the instructions to receive test Ether.

#### Step 4: Spend Ether Per Transaction
1. **Send Ether**:
   - Click on **"Send"** in MetaMask.
   - Enter the recipient's address and the amount of Ether to send.
   - **Transaction Fees**: Before confirming, observe the **gas fee**. This fee is spent for processing the transaction on the network.

2. **Confirm Transaction**:
   - Click **"Next"** and review the transaction details, including the gas fee.
   - Click **"Confirm"** to complete the transaction.

#### Step 5: Study Transaction Costs
- After completing the transaction, you can:
  - Check your wallet balance to see the Ether deducted.
  - View the transaction on Etherscan (if using the mainnet) or the respective block explorer for test networks. This will show you the gas fee and the total cost of the transaction.

#### Key Points to Understand
- **Gas Price**: This is the price per unit of gas, usually denominated in Gwei. It determines how quickly your transaction is processed.
- **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on a transaction. If the transaction uses less, the remaining gas is refunded.
- **Total Cost**: Total cost of a transaction = Amount sent + Gas fee.
