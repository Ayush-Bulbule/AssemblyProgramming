### Ruby on Rails

1. What is Ruby on Rails?
Ruby on Rails is a web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and emphasizes convention over configuration, enabling rapid development of web applications.

2. Explain DRY in Rails?
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a principle in Rails that advocates for reducing duplication by abstracting common functionalities into reusable components such as methods, partials, and modules, enhancing maintainability and reducing errors.

3. What is the current version of Ruby on Rails?
As of my last update, the current version of Ruby on Rails is 6.1.x, but there might be newer versions released since then.

4. Explain CoC in Rails
CoC (Convention over Configuration) in Rails means that the framework makes assumptions about the best way to do things, reducing the need for explicit configuration. Developers adhere to these conventions, which simplifies and speeds up development.

5. Who developed Rails?
Rails was developed by David Heinemeier Hansson (often referred to as DHH) while working on the Basecamp project at 37signals, now known as Basecamp.

6. What are the three methods to install Ruby on Rails?
Ruby on Rails can be installed using RubyGems, RailsInstaller, or by manually installing Ruby and Rails using the command line.

7. What is Rails script? Name some of them?
Rails scripts are command-line tools provided by Rails to perform various tasks such as generating code, running tests, managing databases, etc. Some examples include rails generate, rails server, rails console, and rails db:migrate.

8. Are there any disadvantages of Ruby on Rails? If yes, mention them.
Disadvantages of Ruby on Rails include slower performance compared to some other frameworks, a steeper learning curve for beginners, and potential scalability challenges for very large applications.

9. What is the use of the super function in Ruby on Rails?
In Ruby on Rails, the super function is used to invoke the parent class's implementation of a method when overriding that method in a subclass.

10. What is Active Record in Rails?
Active Record is the M in the MVC pattern in Rails. It is an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer that provides an interface between the application and the database, allowing developers to interact with the database using Ruby objects.

11. Who designed Active Record in Rails?

12. Explain model in Rails?
In Rails, a model represents the data and business logic of the application. It typically corresponds to a table in the database and includes methods for querying, creating, updating, and deleting records.

13. Which command is used to create a migration?

14. What are the hashes?
In Ruby, hashes are data structures that store key-value pairs. They are similar to dictionaries in other programming languages and are commonly used for associative arrays.

15. How are blocks created?
Blocks in Ruby are created by placing code between {} or do...end keywords. They can be passed as arguments to methods and are often used for iteration or as a way to encapsulate behavior.
