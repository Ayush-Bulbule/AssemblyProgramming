### Questions

1. What is struts?<br/>
    Ans: Struts is a framework for developing web applications in Java EE. It uses and extends the Java Servlet API to encourage developers to adopt a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. Struts framework is a standard for developing well-architected web applications. Struts framework is implemented using a set of Java classes and XML configuration files.

2. What is the difference between Struts 1 and Struts 2?<br/>
    Ans: Struts 1 is based on MVC-1 architecture and Struts 2 is based on MVC-2 architecture. Struts 1 is action-based and Struts 2 is component-based. Struts 1 uses ActionServlet as a controller and Struts 2 uses FilterDispatcher as a controller. Struts 1 supports only JSP as a view technology and Struts 2 supports JSP, FreeMarker, and Velocity as view technologies. Struts 1 is not thread-safe and Struts 2 is thread-safe. Struts 1 is slower because it creates a new instance for each request and Struts 2 is faster because it uses the same instance for each request. Struts 1 supports only XML-based configuration and Struts 2 supports both XML and annotation-based configuration.

3. What is the difference between Struts 2 and Spring MVC?<br/>
    Ans: Struts 2 is a web application framework while Spring MVC is a module of the Spring framework. Struts 2 is based on MVC-2 architecture and Spring MVC is based on MVC architecture. Struts 2 is action-based and Spring MVC is component-based. Struts 2 uses FilterDispatcher as a controller and Spring MVC uses DispatcherServlet as a controller. Struts 2 supports JSP, FreeMarker, and Velocity as view technologies and Spring MVC supports JSP, FreeMarker, Velocity, and Thymeleaf as view technologies. Struts 2 is slower because it creates a new instance for each request and Spring MVC is faster because it uses the same instance for each request. Struts 2 supports both XML and annotation-based configuration and Spring MVC supports only annotation-based configuration.
