1. Differentiate between JavaScript and Node.js.
Ans: JavaScript is a scripting language used for web development, while Node.js is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on the server-side.

2. What Is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript, known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

3. List down the major benefits of using Node.js?
Benefits include non-blocking I/O, scalability, fast execution, single-threaded event loop, large ecosystem of packages (NPM), and the ability to use JavaScript for both client and server-side development.

4. What is the difference between Angular and Node.js?
Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework for building web applications, while Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.

5. Why Node.js is single threaded?
Node.js is single-threaded to optimize resource utilization and simplify programming models, utilizing an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

6. How do Node.js works?
Node.js works using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, where requests are processed asynchronously through callback functions, allowing for efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections.

7. Where Node.js can be used?
Node.js can be used for building various types of applications, including web servers, real-time chat applications, streaming servers, API servers, and IoT applications.

8. How many types of API functions are there in Node.js?
In Node.js, there are two types of API functions: Asynchronous, which utilizes callbacks or Promises, and Synchronous, which blocks the execution until the operation is completed.

9. What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
Asynchronous means executing operations independently without waiting for the previous one to complete, while non-blocking means the program can continue to execute other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
10. What is package.json?
package.json is a metadata file in Node.js projects that contains information about the project, including dependencies, scripts, version, and metadata used by package managers like NPM.

11. What do you understand by Event-driven programming?
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs, triggering corresponding actions or callbacks.

12. What is an Event loop in Node.js and how does it work?
The event loop in Node.js is a mechanism that allows asynchronous operations to be handled efficiently by continuously checking the event queue for new events and executing corresponding callback functions.

13. Explain REPL in the context of Node.js.
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, it's an interactive programming environment provided by Node.js where developers can enter JavaScript expressions and see the results immediately.

14. List down the tasks which should be done asynchronously using the event loop?
Tasks such as file I/O operations, network requests, database queries, and other time-consuming operations should be done asynchronously using the event loop to avoid blocking the main thread.

15. List down the steps using which “Control Flow” controls the function calls in Node.js?
Control flow in Node.js is managed through asynchronous functions, callback functions, Promises, async/await, and control flow libraries like async.js, which ensure proper sequencing and error handling of function calls.
