## Assignment 10 EJB

### Questions

1. What is EJB?<br/>
    Ans: EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) is a server-side software component that encapsulates the business logic of an application. An EJB web container provides a runtime environment for web-related software components, including computer security, Java servlet lifecycle management, transaction support, and other web services.

2. What is the difference between EJB 2.0 and EJB 3.0?<br/>
    Ans: EJB 2.0 is complex and heavyweight because it requires a lot of boilerplate code and XML configuration. EJB 3.0 is lightweight and easy to develop because it uses annotations for configuration. EJB 2.0 uses JNDI for dependency injection and EJB 3.0 uses annotations for dependency injection. EJB 2.0 uses home and remote interfaces for business logic and EJB 3.0 uses POJO (Plain Old Java Object) for business logic. EJB 2.0 uses ejb-jar.xml for deployment descriptor and EJB 3.0 uses annotations for deployment descriptor. EJB 2.0 uses container-managed persistence (CMP) for database access and EJB 3.0 uses Java Persistence API (JPA) for database access.

3. What is the difference between EJB and Spring?<br/>
    Ans: EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates the business logic of an application while Spring is a lightweight framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications. EJB is part of the Java EE platform and Spring is a standalone framework. EJB is complex and heavyweight because it requires a lot of boilerplate code and XML configuration while Spring is lightweight and easy to develop because it uses annotations for configuration. EJB uses JNDI for dependency injection and Spring uses annotations for dependency injection. EJB uses home and remote interfaces for business logic and Spring uses POJO (Plain Old Java Object) for business logic. EJB uses ejb-jar.xml for deployment descriptor and Spring uses annotations for deployment descriptor. EJB uses container-managed persistence (CMP) for database access and Spring uses Java Persistence API (JPA) for database access.
